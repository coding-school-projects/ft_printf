## Summary
This project involves recreating the standard C library function `printf()`, focusing on handling **variable arguments** and formatted output. The goal is to produce a lightweight version (`ft_printf`) that supports key conversions and adheres to strict performance and memory management standards.

---

## Features
### Mandatory Conversions
- `%c` : Character  
- `%s` : String  
- `%p` : Pointer address (hexadecimal)  
- `%d`, `%i` : Signed decimal integer  
- `%u` : Unsigned decimal integer  
- `%x`, `%X` : Hexadecimal (lowercase/uppercase)  
- `%%` : Percent sign  

### Bonus (Optional)
- **Flags**: `-0.` (left-justify, zero-pad, precision)  
- **Modifiers**: `# +` (alternate form, force sign, space padding)

## üßë‚Äçüíª Peer Evaluations (3/3)
Peer 1: "Poonkodi has done great job getting all format specifiers work as intended. She had decided to cut the exucution when unknown format specifier was encountered, which I interpreted to follow the vague instructions given in the subject. She also justified not including libft to the makefile. Only minor mistake was in the headerfile, where I found an double found_u function prototype but it did not have any effect to the functionality of the work. Therefore, I ignored that. Good work, and good luck for the future."

Peer 2: "Poonkodi, has shown great confidence in her code and has a great attitude towards the project. She has a great attitude towards the school and is a very positive person, she obviously knows what she's doing. Great job poonkodi, good luck!"

Peer 3: "Everything worked and passed all the tests. Good job!"
